# LibreESP

For [Espressif's ESP8266][esp8266] microcontroller there exists two binary SDKs. The [NON-OS SDK][nonos] and the [RTOS SDK][rtos]. LibreESP is the attemp to create a free and open SDK written in C++11. Goals are to use the power of C++11 while having a modular SDK with a low memory footprint.

Because this is my first real C++ project I have to learn a lot about C++ and memory optimizations, so contributions and code reviews are very welcome.
